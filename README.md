# settings

These are my Awesome Windows Manager settings, NeoVIM settings and some other useful stuff.

I use it all the time when installing systems on new machines or when I simply need to access my most common configs. Feel free to look into them and use them.

install.sh is a simple script which I use to automatically set some stuff up. It's mostly copying config files to the right places
